# TaskForge Requirements

## Project Overview
TaskForge is an AI-powered project management tool that leverages the innovative infinite canvas concept pioneered by [tlbrowse](https://github.com/SawyerHood/tlbrowse) by Sawyer Hood. While tlbrowse focuses on generating imagined websites, TaskForge adapts this powerful AI-based autogeneration capability to create and visualize Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) for projects.

### Acknowledgments
We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Sawyer Hood for creating tlbrowse and sharing this innovative approach to AI-powered visualization. The infinite canvas concept and AI integration patterns from tlbrowse have been instrumental in shaping TaskForge's core architecture and user experience.
