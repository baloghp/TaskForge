# TaskForge Coding Best Practices

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the coding best practices and standards to be followed during the development of TaskForge. Adhering to these guidelines ensures code quality, maintainability, consistency, and collaboration efficiency.

## 2. General Principles
- **Clean Code:** Write code that is readable, understandable, and maintainable. Strive for simplicity and clarity.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code. Utilize functions, classes, and modules to promote reusability.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prefer simple solutions over complex ones whenever possible.
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Avoid implementing functionality that is not currently required.

## 3. Code Style & Formatting
- **Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the chosen style guide for each language used in the project (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Prettier defaults for JavaScript/TypeScript).
- **Linters & Formatters:** Utilize automated tools (like `flake8`, `black`, `eslint`, `prettier`) integrated into the development workflow (e.g., pre-commit hooks) to enforce style and catch potential errors early.

## 4. Modularity & Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns:** Design components and modules with distinct responsibilities (e.g., UI rendering, state management, AI logic, API interactions).
- **Loose Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between modules to improve modularity and testability.
- **High Cohesion:** Group related functionality within the same module.
- **API Design:** Internal APIs between components should be well-defined and documented.

## 5. Testing Strategy
- **Test Pyramid:** Emphasize a strong foundation of unit tests, complemented by integration tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
- **Unit Tests:** Each module or function should have corresponding unit tests covering its logic and edge cases. Aim for high code coverage.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between different components (e.g., frontend <-> backend, backend <-> AI service).
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate user workflows to validate the application as a whole.
- **AI Model Testing:** Include specific tests for AI model behavior, accuracy (where applicable), robustness to varied inputs, and failure modes.
- **Visualization Testing:** Consider snapshot testing or visual regression testing for UI components, especially the infinite canvas.

## 6. Documentation
- **Code Comments:** Use comments judiciously to explain *why* something is done, not *what* it does (if the code is self-explanatory). Document complex algorithms, assumptions, or non-obvious logic.
- **Docstrings:** Write clear docstrings for public functions, classes, and modules, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **READMEs:** Maintain informative README files at the project root and within key directories, explaining setup, usage, and module purpose.
- **Architecture Documentation:** Document high-level architecture decisions, data flows, and component interactions (e.g., in `requirements/technical/`).

## 7. Version Control (Git)
- **Branching Strategy:** Follow a consistent branching model (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow). Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feat/add-user-auth`, `fix/canvas-rendering-bug`).
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and informative commit messages following conventional commit standards if possible.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Use PRs for code review. PR descriptions should explain the changes and link to relevant issues/requirements.

## 8. Dependency Management
- **Explicit Dependencies:** Declare all project dependencies explicitly using package managers (`pip`, `npm`, `yarn`, etc.).
- **Lock Files:** Commit lock files (`requirements.txt`, `poetry.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure reproducible builds.
- **Minimize Dependencies:** Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies. Regularly review and update existing ones.

## 9. Error Handling & Logging
- **Robust Handling:** Implement proper error handling mechanisms (e.g., try-except blocks, Result types) instead of suppressing errors.
- **Informative Logging:** Use structured logging to record important events, errors, and debugging information. Configure appropriate log levels for different environments.
- **User Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to the user when errors occur.

## 10. Security
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all external inputs (user input, API responses).
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust mechanisms to secure endpoints and user data.
- **Dependency Security:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Secrets Management:** Do not commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords) directly into the codebase. Use environment variables or a secrets management solution.

## 11. Performance
- **Frontend:** Optimize rendering performance, especially for the infinite canvas. Use techniques like virtualization, debouncing/throttling event handlers, and code splitting.
- **Backend:** Optimize database queries, API response times, and computational tasks. Profile code to identify bottlenecks.
- **AI Models:** Optimize model inference time and resource usage. Consider techniques like quantization or model pruning if necessary.

## 12. AI Development Specifics
- **Model Versioning:** Track AI models and datasets used for training (e.g., using tools like MLflow, DVC).
- **Data Privacy:** Handle user data used for AI training or inference securely and ethically, complying with relevant regulations.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure AI experiments and model training processes are reproducible.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Design the system to handle AI model failures or unavailability gracefully.

## 13. Code Review Process
- **Mandatory Reviews:** All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
- **Constructive Feedback:** Reviews should be thorough, constructive, and respectful. Focus on code quality, adherence to standards, correctness, and potential issues.
- **Timeliness:** Aim for timely reviews to avoid blocking development progress.
