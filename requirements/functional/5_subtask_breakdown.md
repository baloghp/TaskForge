# 5. Subtask Breakdown Functional Requirement

## User Story

As a user, after a list of tasks has been generated for a workstream, I want to be able to click on the name of a specific task.
Upon clicking a task name, I want the application to potentially interact with the AI again (using the context of the charter, workstream, and parent task) to generate a list of subtasks required for that specific task.
This list of subtasks should then be displayed in a new, distinct visual element (e.g., a new 'Task' shape or similar) linked to the parent task.
I want the ability to repeat this process, clicking on a subtask to break it down further into more detailed sub-subtasks, as many times as I find necessary.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Task names within a displayed task list are clickable elements.
- When a user clicks on a task name:
    - The application identifies the selected task.
    - The application (potentially) sends relevant context (charter, workstream info, parent task name/description) to the AI service to generate subtasks.
    - The AI service returns a list of subtasks (each with at least a name and description) or indicates if no further breakdown is suggested.
- A new, distinct visual element (e.g., a new shape) appears, clearly associated with the parent task.
- This new element displays the generated list of subtasks (name and description).
- Subtask names within this new element are also clickable.
- Clicking a subtask name repeats the process: triggers AI generation for sub-subtasks and displays them in another new, associated visual element.
- This hierarchical breakdown can be performed recursively to any desired level of detail.
