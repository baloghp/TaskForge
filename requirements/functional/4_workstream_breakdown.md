# 4. Work Stream Breakdown Functional Requirement

## User Story

As a user, after workstreams have been generated and listed, I want to be able to click on the name (link) of a specific workstream.
Upon clicking a workstream link, I want the application to interact with the AI to generate a list of tasks required to complete that workstream.
The AI should consider the overall project charter, the specific workstream's description, and the descriptions of other workstreams to ensure tasks are relevant and avoid duplication.
This generated list of tasks, showing just the task name and description for each, should then be presented clearly, perhaps in a simple list format associated with the selected workstream.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Workstream names within the Charter shape's workstream list are clickable links.
- When a user clicks on a workstream link:
    - The application identifies the selected workstream.
    - The application sends the project charter, the selected workstream's name and description, and the names/descriptions of *all* other generated workstreams to the AI service.
    - The AI service returns a list of tasks for the selected workstream, each task having a name and a description.
- The generated task list is displayed to the user.
- The task list presentation is simple, showing only the name and description for each task.
- The display format clearly associates the task list with the clicked workstream (e.g., appears next to it, in a modal, or replaces a section of the view).
